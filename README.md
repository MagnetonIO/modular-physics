# Modular Physics: A Compositional Framework for Fundamental Laws

## Overview

This repository implements a **modular physics** framework where fundamental physical laws emerge from the composition of independent information-theoretic constraints. Rather than seeking a single unified "Theory of Everything," we embrace the idea that reality operates through multiple, composable physical principles that can be applied independently or combined when their domains overlap.

## Core Philosophy

Traditional physics seeks unification through reduction to a single fundamental theory. Our approach is different:

- **Modularity**: Each physical constraint operates independently in its domain
- **Composability**: Multiple constraints can be combined consistently when needed
- **Emergence**: Complex phenomena arise from constraint composition
- **Portability**: Code is designed to be easily translated between languages (Haskell → Python, etc.)

## Fundamental Laws Implemented

Based on research from information-energy equivalence and conversion laws, we implement four core modules:

### 1. Size-Aware Energy Conversion
```
E ≥ (ℏc ln 2)/(2πkR) · I
```
The minimum energy required to localize information I within spatial extent R.

### 2. Thermal Information Processing  
```
E_proc/erase ≥ kT ln 2 · I
```
Landauer's principle: the fundamental energy cost of information processing at temperature T.

### 3. Geometric Emergence
```
I ~ Area/(4ℓ_P² ln 2)
```
When information saturates holographic bounds, spacetime geometry emerges.

### 4. Gravitational Information Flow
```
δS = δQ/T ⟹ G_μν + Λg_μν = (8πG/c⁴)T_μν
```
Einstein's equations emerge from thermodynamic information flow across horizons.

## Core Principles

### Information-Energy Equivalence
Building on the foundational work showing **E = Ic²** (where I is information density), we implement:
- Information as the fundamental substrate of reality
- Mass as emergent from information density patterns
- Energy as the computational cost of maintaining information coherence

### Quantum Error Correction
Physical reality emerges from quantum error-correcting codes that:
- Generate spacetime geometry from entanglement patterns
- Maintain coherence through active error correction
- Define particle states as stable information configurations

energy = sizeAwareEnergy 1.0 (1e-9) -- Returns energy in Joules
```

-- Calculate Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
solarMassBlackHole = blackHole (solarMasses 1.0)
entropy = bekensteinHawking solarMassBlackHole
```

## Theoretical Foundations

This framework builds on several key insights:

1. **Information is Physical**: Every bit must be physically instantiated (Landauer)
2. **Holographic Principle**: Information scales with area, not volume ('t Hooft, Susskind)
3. **Emergent Spacetime**: Geometry emerges from entanglement (Van Raamsdonk, Swingle)
4. **Thermodynamic Gravity**: Einstein equations from horizon thermodynamics (Jacobson)

## Applications
